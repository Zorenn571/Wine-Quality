# Wine-Quality

### Portugal is a top ten wine exporting country with 3.17% of the market share in 2005. To support its growth, the wine industry is investing in new technologies for both wine making and selling processes. Wine certification and quality assessment are key elements within this context. Certification prevents the illegal adulteration of wines (to safeguard human health) and assures quality for the wine market. Quality evaluation is often part of the certification process and can be used to improve wine making (by identifying the most influential factors) and to stratify wines such as premium brands (useful for setting prices).

### In this practice exercise, I work with a wine dataset, create data mining models to help predict wine quality, and identify key factors in this quality evaluation process.
